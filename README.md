# Excel VBA Scripting Challenge
VBA Script Code - https://github.com/MichaelELeonard/VBA-challenge/blob/main/Module%202%20challenge%20VBA%20Script%20Files.vbs

## Background
For this assignment we were tasked to write VBA script that multiple years of data and create a summary table that identifies each stocks ticker symbol, yearly change and color the cell green if the data is positive and red is negative, calculate the percentage of the change, and the total stock volume for the year.  Once the information is tabulated for each individual stock, the code will identify the stock on the sheet with the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and the Greatest Total Volume.  This VBA code will examine multiple years of data producing the desired results on separate sheets in the workbook for the years 2018, 2019 & 2020.
* Stock Ticker Name
* Yearly change in the Stock Price (+Green/- Red)
* Yearly change in the Stock Price (<span style="background-color: #6cc644">+Green </span>)

<span style="background-color: #bd2c00">- Red </span>



* Yearly Percent Change in the Stock Price
* Yearly Total Stock Volume 

## Results
3000 individual stocks were examined for 2018, 2019 & 2020.  For each year the VBA script identified yearly statistics for each stock that included :
* Stock Ticker Name
* Yearly change in the Stock Price
* Yearly Percent Change in the Stock Price
* Yearly Total Stock Volume 
* Stock Ticker Name and Percent Change in the Stock Price that had the Greatest Increase, Greatest Decrease and Greatest Volume for the year.
